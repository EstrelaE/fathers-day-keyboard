# fathers-day-keyboard
Recreated the 1st class of JavaScript30 as a personalised father's day gift. Built a "keyboard" that plays the words of a lullaby he wrote for me as a baby. (it's in portuguese btw)
Ignore my bad voice, until I have a recording of him singing, we have to suffer! I even had a cold when recording, so It's not all my lack of talent!
