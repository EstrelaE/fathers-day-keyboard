# fathers-day-keyboard
A "keyboard" that plays the words of a lullaby my father wrote for me as a baby *(it's in portuguese btw)*. I created this as a father's day gift.

Ignore my bad voice, until I have a recording of him singing, we have to suffer... I actually had a cold when recording, so It's not all my lack of talent!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was a learning activity as I decided to recreate the 1st class of JavaScript30 as a personalised father's day gift. A great project to realize more possibilites of what we can create with programming, with JavaScript in this case.

## Optimizations
*Work in process*

Would like to improve the fact that it gets stuck with yellow shadow when key is pressed to many consecutive times

## Lessons Learned:

This project was great for active recall. Learning is very important for me, and active recalling is a key method in my learning process. I didn't specifically struggle with that first class of JavaScript30, but it was challenging, so I knew I should recreate it alone to make sure what I had learned was solidified.
